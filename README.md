# Hit-Song-Prediction
A Random Forest model predicts whether a song will be a hit or a flop by analyzing features like instrumentalness, danceability, loudness, valence, acousticness, and key. By combining predictions from multiple decision trees, it reduces overfitting and improves accuracy, leading to more reliable predictions.
